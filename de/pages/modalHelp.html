	We produce file batch as you order it.
	<br>
	Select the columns and configure them. You can choose between 3 data types:
	<br>
	1. Text
	<br>
	2. Date
	<br>
	3. Number
	<br>
	<h4>1. Text</h4>
	It is possible to generate some random Text records. You can choose a fixed value or configure it thanks to the
	possibility to build by your home a string with a fixed PREFIX or SUFFIX or COUNTER. Counter can also simulate a
	string replacing empty spaces with 0 zero. You can mix all configurations, but only if FIXED VALUE is not set.
	<h4>2. Date</h4>
	We can generate dates with the format you like and selecting between a date range or even generate completely
	random dates.
	<h4>3. Number</h4>
	You can configure your number Column as you like, you can define a number range and also configure decimal sepator
	and numbers of decimals to put inside the file.
